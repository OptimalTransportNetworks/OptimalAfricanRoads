# Notes
- The [Julia Libray](https://github.com/OptimalTransportNetworks/OptimalTransportNetworks.jl) was used to compute results reported in sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the paper. It can be installed using `import Pkg; Pkg.add("OptimalTransportNetworks")`. Use with the file `optimal_trans_african_networks_largest_pcities.jl`.

- The [MATLAB Toolbox](https://github.com/OptimalTransportNetworks/OptimalTransportNetworkToolbox) was used for the results reported in section 6.2.3. Please see the [User Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OptimalTransportNetworks/OptimalTransportNetworkToolbox/main/docs/User%20Guide.pdf) for installation instructions. Use with the file `optimal_trans_african_networks_largest_pcities.m`. As decribed in the file with the NOTE at the beginning, For section 6.2.3 search and replace "fastest_routes" with "all_routes", set beta = 1 and CrossGoodCongestion 'off'. 

- The R script `analyze_trans_african_results.R` is used to read the CSV files generated by these scripts and compute summary statistics and the plots reported. 

- Results are saved under results/transport_network/GE/trans_african/ for Secions 6.2.1 and 6.2.2, and under results/transport_network/GE/trans_african_add/ for Section 6.2.3. Thus, the production of statistics and graphics can be verified without solving all the networks again (which would take weeks).
